Easily convert your SQL database into a REST API, using the SQLConnector action from Form.io
====================================================
This is a lightweight Express.js middleware library that is able to convert SQL databases into a REST API. Using data
from your [Form.io](https://form.io) project, routes are dynamically generated along with the SQL code to allow you to
create forms in [Form.io](https://form.io), and have the contents automatically inserted into your SQL Database.
Please go to https://form.io to learn more.

**For now, this library only supports Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.**

Enjoy!
